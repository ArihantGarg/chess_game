This is a repository containing the code for running a basic chess game

     Notes and Rules :- 

1)There is no checkmate as of yet,you need to capture the opponents king

2)There is no indication of check,and hence some illegal moves are possible

3)Stalemate currently doesn't encompass all possiblities
